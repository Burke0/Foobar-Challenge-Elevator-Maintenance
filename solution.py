# The solution function takes a list of elevator versions as input and returns the sorted list.
# It uses a version_key function to convert each version string into a tuple of integers, where each integer represents the major, minor, and revision number of the version. 
# This key function is then used to sort the input list using the built-in sorted function.
# The version_key function works by splitting the version string into its parts using the split method, and then mapping the parts to integers using the map function. Finally, it returns a tuple of the integer parts.
# This solution should work for all valid inputs within the constraints given in the problem statement.
